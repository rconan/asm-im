The wind loads applied to FEM of the telescope have been computing with
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations.
The CFD model\cite{GMT.DOC.05211} of the telescope and enclosure is based on CAD drawings released
for the PDR of the GMT mount and the GMT enclosure.
A database of dome seeing, wind loads and heat transfer coefficients from 60 CFD
simulations covering a range of wind speed and orientation,
telescope pointing and enclosure configurations have been
built\cite{GMT.DOC.05214}.

Using the CFD wind loads on the telescope FEM,
the time series of rigid body motions of M1 and M2 segments and of the
truss--to--top-end interface have been computed for 15 CFD cases, as listed in
Table~\ref{tab:cfd-cases}.
The mapping and transformations of the CFD wind loads to FEM wind loads is
described in \cite{GMT.DOC.05506}.
The 1st few seconds of the wind loads are weighted with a sigmoid:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:sigmoid}
  S(t) = {1 \over \left( 1 + \exp(-5\left( t - 0.75 \right)) \right)^2}
\end{equation}
in order to avoid step-driven excitation of the telescope FEM.
The CFD wind loads are originally sampled at 20Hz, the wind loads applied to the FEM are
sampled a 8kHz using linear interpolation.
